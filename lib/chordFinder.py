# This file returns tablature for chords in different positions and voicings

# TODO: we need to itemize all chords in the song and major/minor/diminshed/augmented/dom7/maj7/etc (we can support more voicings as we go)
#       then for each chord, get location for each (C A G E D) shape
#         for each shape, generate finger position tab, like so:
#           B       x24442
#           C#m     x46654
#           Amaj7   x02120
#           F#m     244222
#           Am6     x04555
#
